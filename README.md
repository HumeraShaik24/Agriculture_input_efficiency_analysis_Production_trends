# 🚜 Agriculture Input Efficiency & Yield Analysis Dashboard  
**Tool Used**: Power BI Desktop | Python | DAX  
**Domain**: Agriculture Analytics  
**Project Type**: Exploratory Data Analysis + Forecasting

---

## 📌 Objective  
To analyze the impact of agricultural inputs (fertilizer and pesticide) on crop yield and production across Indian states. The project uncovers regional input efficiency variations and provides future yield and production forecasts using data-driven insights.

## 📊 Key Features of the [Dashboard](Dashboard/Agriculture.png)

- **Custom KPIs**:
  - Total Area, Production, Average Yield, Fertilizer & Pesticide Used
- **Efficiency Visuals**:
  - Fertilizer & Pesticide Efficiency by Crop
  - State-wise Efficiency Maps (Bubble Maps)
- **Crop Performance**:
  - Yield Distribution by Crop
- **Forecasting**:
  - Time-series prediction of crop production for the next 5 years using Python (Linear Regression)
- **Interactivity**:
  - State slicers for region-specific insights

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Identified Coconut and Sugarcane as crops with the **highest fertilizer efficiency**
- Detected **inefficiencies in pesticide usage** for several crops
- **Forecasted a 6.4% increase** in national crop production over the next 5 years under current trends
- Predicted an **18–22% potential improvement** in yield efficiency through optimized fertilizer application
